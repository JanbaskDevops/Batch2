In DevOps We have 8 Phases-

1) Plan: What I want to make, How I want to make and requirement gathering phase[Java, cloud, ....]

2) Code: I would be writing code for my application

3) Build: In my application we have two things 1) Application logic, 2) Presentation logic
                                                    c=a+b # Application/business login
                                                      GUI for calculator # Presentation logic

        In this phase we combine presentation logic and business logic


4) Test: We perform testing to identify we are doing correct or not

We have multiple environment- Dev, Test, QA, preprod and Prod

Deployment- Doing activity on server

5) Release- Deployment on Dev, test, QA, preprod

6) Deploy- Deployment on production

7) Operate- doing day to day maintenance

8) Monitor- monitoring the application

Example: I want to make E-learning website

tools:

Plan- Jira, azure board

code- git

build- maven

Test- DAST[Dynamic application security testing] and SAST[Static application security testing]

Release and deploy- Docker ad Kubernetes

Operate

monitor- Splunk

Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins
