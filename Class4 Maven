JB11305 DevOps-22ndJuly2024  Class8 maven 
==========================================

In DevOps we have 8 phases-

Plan code Build Test
Release Deploy Operate monitor

Maven?
It's a build tool

What is Build?
When you are creating any software you would be having 2 things-

1) Presentation logic: Look and feel
2) Business logic: it's about the main logic

Build tool will combine both the logic and generate the artifact.

How to install maven tool
==========================
apt-get update
apt install maven -y

ubuntu $ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.6.3
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 11.0.23, vendor: Ubuntu, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: ANSI_X3.4-1968
OS name: "linux", version: "5.4.0-131-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"

How maven is working?
=====================
1) Developer is writing the code in GitHub and share URL with us
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git

2) to get this code locally, we need to run below command
     >>> git clone <URL>
         git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git

Maven goal
==========

    validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
    compile - compile the source code of the project
    test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
    package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
    verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
    install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
    deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

How to compile java program?
============================
1) write a java program pragramname.java

2) javac <program name>

3) java <program name>

Prework:

We need to install java

command:
=======
apt-get update
apt install openjdk-17-jdk-headless -y

# Step 1: Write the Java Program
echo 'public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}' > HelloWorld.java

# Step 2: Compile the Java Program
javac HelloWorld.java

# Step 3: Create a Manifest File
echo 'Main-Class: HelloWorld' > manifest.txt

# Step 4: Create the JAR File
jar cfm HelloWorld.jar manifest.txt HelloWorld.class

# Step 5: Run the JAR File
java -jar HelloWorld.jar

2) Source code structure
src- source

Example of Calculator-

Add

Substract

Multiply

devide

screen.java

Now, to compile all the java file in once  

maven package

>> It is a file which has information about dependencies, and project basic information
